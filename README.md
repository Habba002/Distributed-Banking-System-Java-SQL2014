# Distributed banking system using Java & SQL 2014
This is a banking system for Distributed System course in Addis Ababa University Ethiopia MSc Computer Science stream.

We implemented the project in Java and use SQL 2014 database. The system contains two project one a client side and other server side.
  
  1. The client side contain client side Java web-based program
  2. The server side contains Java webservice and RMI code with database integration Java code.
  
  
In order to run the project you need to have two independent machine. One for the client another for the server. Then you need to configure 
  1. some code in the client source code like the location of the server machine.
  2. You should have SQL server on the serverside machine and import bank.sql file then configure you server side Java code.
  3. Run the server webservice by running the project and run RMI code in the server code.
  4. Finally run the client machine and everything is okey.
